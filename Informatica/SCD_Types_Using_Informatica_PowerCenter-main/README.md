# README - Implementing SCD Types in Informatica PowerCenter

## Overview üåü
This repository contains three projects demonstrating the implementation of Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) in **Informatica PowerCenter**. These projects cover the implementation of **SCD Type 1**, **SCD Type 2**, and **SCD Type 3**, which are used to manage historical data in data warehouses by tracking changes to dimension attributes over time.

Each project follows a step-by-step approach to implementing the respective SCD types, ensuring that data transformations are handled efficiently based on the business requirements.

## Project 1: **SCD Type 1 - Overwriting Data üîÑ**
- **Goal**: To overwrite the existing record with the latest information.
- **Description**: In **SCD Type 1**, when a change occurs, the old data is overwritten with the new data, effectively discarding historical values. This is typically used when historical accuracy is not critical, and only the most recent data is required.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Extract data from the source.
  2. Use **Lookup Transformation** to check if the record exists in the target.
  3. Insert new records and update existing records with the latest values.

## Project 2: **SCD Type 2 - Tracking Historical Changes üìÖ**
- **Goal**: To track and store all historical changes to dimension attributes.
- **Description**: In **SCD Type 2**, historical data is maintained by creating a new record whenever there is a change. This allows for full historical accuracy by storing both current and historical records with an effective date and expiration date. Typically used for tracking attributes like customer addresses, where knowing the historical record is crucial.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Extract data from the source.
  2. Compare source data with target data using a **Lookup Transformation**.
  3. Insert new records or update existing records by adding effective and expiration dates to manage historical data.

## Project 3: **SCD Type 3 - Storing Limited Historical Data üìä**
- **Goal**: To track only a limited number of historical changes.
- **Description**: **SCD Type 3** is used to track and store limited historical data. Typically, only the most recent and one previous value for a specific attribute is stored. For example, customer location changes are tracked by storing the current and previous location, which helps when the number of changes is small and historical accuracy is not as critical as in SCD Type 2.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Extract data from the source.
  2. Use **Lookup Transformation** to check if the record exists in the target.
  3. For updates, update the `current` and `previous` values of the attribute.
  4. Insert new records where necessary.

## Project Flow üîÑ

- **Source Table**: Contains raw data representing the dimension entities (e.g., customers).
- **Target Table**: Stores the transformed data where historical changes are managed according to the respective SCD type.
- **Common Transformations**:
  - **Source Qualifier**: Extracts data from the source.
  - **Lookup**: Matches existing records in the target.
  - **Expression**: Performs logic to decide whether to insert or update data.
  - **Router**: Routes data for insertion or update paths.
  - **Sequence Generator**: Creates surrogate keys for new records.
  - **Update Strategy**: Defines how updates are applied to existing records.

## Key Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **Efficient Data Management**: These implementations ensure that historical data is tracked accurately according to the specific requirements of each SCD type.
- **Informatica PowerCenter**: Leveraging Informatica PowerCenter for ETL processes, including data extraction, transformation, and loading into target tables.
- **Handling Different Business Scenarios**: Each SCD type is tailored for different business needs, such as overwriting data (SCD Type 1), tracking full history (SCD Type 2), or tracking only limited history (SCD Type 3).

## Conclusion üéØ
This repository demonstrates the practical implementation of SCD Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 in Informatica PowerCenter. These approaches help organizations manage and store dimension data in a way that meets business requirements for historical accuracy, performance, and simplicity. Each SCD type is designed for specific use cases in data warehousing and helps ensure that data remains accurate and up-to-date.
